Differences Between the `var` and `let` keywords. It is very simple thing which is diffrent scoped.
`var` is function scope, Conversely `let` is block scoped.
As well JavaScript has `const` variable which can define the immutable variable.

```JavaScript
let foo;
var foo;
const FOO;
```

`"use strict";` which means using strict mode. If you use this mode, you can use more polite syntax. Therefore browser accurate check the error.
i```JavaScript
"use strict";
x = 3.14; // throws an error because x is not declared
```
